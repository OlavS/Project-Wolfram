		<p>This app features functions that will not only make the life of our elderly better, but will also make the job of the “home-nurse” easier, and will reassure many families that their elderly is getting proper and professional treatment. </p>
		<p>Our system will make a personal page to each registered patient. Each patient’s page will include a list of needs that will be fulfilled every day if no other information is given. The patient’s page will also include all the impairments of the patient, which will help the home-nurse do a better job taking care of the patient. Another feature on the patient’s personal page is the comment section. In the comment section, everybody can leave comments that is accessible by the doctor, family members, nurses… … The comments that is posted can be tweaked to be only accessible by the doctor or only accessible by the family. This will make it cleaner for the doctor, and make it easier for him to see only relevant information regarding the patient. </p>
		<p>The Care+ app connects the user to the patient’s personal page. A checklist of tasks, impairments, comments and other information will be available for the user to access. For the nurses and drivers, a schedule will be accessible and will consist of the time the patient will be visited, the name of the patient and the address with a GPS module for the ease of transportation. The app will contain a QR-scanner that can scan the QR-note in each patient’s homes. When the nurse scans the QR-code she will check-in with the patient, giving her the checked-in status for the family to see. When the nurse’s tasks are done and the patient has all their needs taken care of, the nurse will scan the QR-code again to check-out and be on the way to the next patient.</p>
