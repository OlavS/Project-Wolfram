		<p>This app features functions that will not only make the life of our elderly better, but will also make the job of the healthcare worker and many others easier, and will reassure many families that their elderly is getting proper and professional treatment. </p>
		<p>Our system will make a personal page to each registered patient. Each patient’s page will include a list of needs that will be fulfilled every day if no other information is given. The patient’s page will also include all the impairments of the patient, which will help the healthcare worker do a better job taking care of the patient. Another feature on the patient’s personal page is the comment section. In the comment section, everybody can leave comments that is accessible by; the doctor, healthcare workers, the family, nurses, the state, the senior center and the driver. The comments that is posted can be tweaked to be accessible by certain people. This will reduce the amount of non-relevant comments each person will receive. For instance, the doctor has no need to see the comments that is directed towards the family.  </p>
		<p>The Care+ app connects the user to the patient’s personal page. A checklist of tasks, impairments, comments and other information will be available for the user to access. For the nurses, healthcare workers and drivers, a schedule will be accessible and will consist of the time the patient will be visited, the name of the patient and the address with a GPS module for the ease of transportation. The app will contain a QR-scanner that can scan the QR-note in each patient’s homes. When the healthcare worker scans the QR-code, she will check-in with the patient, giving him/her the “checked-in” status. When the tasks are done and the patient has all their needs taken care of, the nurse will scan the QR-code again to check-out and be on the way to the next patient. </p>
