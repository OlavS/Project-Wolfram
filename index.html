	<div id="inBox">Our concept is based on research done in the Norwegian healthcare system. A demand 
	for a better infrastructure considering patients, healthpersonal, and familymembers. 
	<br></br>
	With the ever growing life expectancy, it is inevitable that there will be more elderly people, and as a consequence, 
	the use of Home Help is more and more common.
	The problem lies with the unprofessional and unorganized workers. It has been too many instances where the 
	worker either forgets to tend to one of the patients, or forgets to give the patient the necessity, for example his/her 
	medicine or supplements. In addition to that, the patients are commonly affected by dementia, and they may not even remember 
	if they have eaten, nor if they have been taken care of. Because of this, the faith of the families using this service for their 
	elderly loved ones will diminish, and the use of the service will be an unpleasant experience.

		A efficient QR code system is implemented, to make it easy for the home help to scan in to the patients home.
		From there they get all the information they need, and they can contact relatives, the patients doctor, and other 
		co workers that have visited the patient in the past. Its also possible to order groceries and post/send important 
		information from here to those who need to know.
